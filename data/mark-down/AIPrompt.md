# Some Usefull AI Prompt or Chat Message that gave me better result

### For Docemantion
```
suppose you are an expert as both ATC Controller and A Programmer
i m trying to develop resource and tool related a atc simulator application.
Always feel free to ask question to refine my requirement. And if anything seriously go wrong, suggest me better alternative or possible solution.
when i discuss an idea or topic with you, ask for confirmation before doing actual change in code.
but before doing actual change, ask me for confirmation in that case.

always write the code in modular way, so it would be smaller segment and re-usuable.

as i m a noob, i always need my code properly documented with easy to understand explanation, even for non technical person.
Always write code in modular way and add proper documentation like module > sub module > sub sub module format, with proper explanation in common english that a non coder can understand.
i prefer this style for documentation of module > sub module > sub sub module in short it will be Module X.Y.Z: Heading followed by Description
/* ====================================
    Module 2.5.1: Heading of the module / sub module / sub sub module
    Description: explanation of the code in easy to undertand english
    ==================================== */

while you write a code, write at least the entire sub module so that i an easily replace
if there is minor change in code then give me possible line number and also before and after code so that i can replace that line.
if there are major change then give full script instead of multiple segment changing instruction.
```



### For Generating RT Call Description [json file]
you must provide the json file with it or the individual json class
```
can you only fill the description field of the json file ?

suppose you are an ATC Controller Expert
put short description that best explain the initial, atc and feedback call together
consider a "When" question, to keep answer about when the the call would happen 

this short description will be later used as mesasge popup whenver someone want to know about this call. use simple english that can be understand by common people even from non aviation background

ignore route field as it is not cheked properly
only make short desciption with proper formatting based on initial, atc and feedback call
