# Some Usefull AI Prompt or Chat Message that gave me better result

### For Docemantion
```
Always feel free to ask question to refine my requirement. And if anything seriously might go wrong, suggest me better alternative or possible solution but before doing actual change, ask me for confirmation in that case.

Always write code in modular way and add proper documentation like module and sub module with proper explanation in common english that a non coder can understand.
if there is minor change in code then give me possible line number and also before and after code so that i can replace that line or module.
if there are major change then give full script instead of multiple segment changing instruction.
if you change a module or sub module, give me that entire sub module up to next sub module.
as i m a noob, i always need my code proper documented. 
i prefer this module sub module documentation style

### For Generating RT Call Description [json file]
you must provide the json file with it or the individual json class
```
can you only fill the description field of the json file ?

suppose you are an ATC Controller Expert
put short description that best explain the initial, atc and feedback call together
consider a "When" question, to keep answer about when the the call would happen 

this short description will be later used as mesasge popup whenver someone want to know about this call. use simple english that can be understand by common people even from non aviation background

ignore route field as it is not cheked properly
only make short desciption with proper formatting based on initial, atc and feedback call
